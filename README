REDDIT GAME ANALYSIS APPLICATION

Creator: Alex Mascoli

The purpose of this application is to use a text sentiment analyzer to analyze a Reddit game thread's comments to see how fans reacted over the course of the game.

Ideally, the reddit reactions will be compared with the ESPN win percentage tracker and there will be some correlation.

Currently using Indico.io as a text sentiment analyzer.

TODO:
* Set a data range for posts to search.
* Instead of Team 1 and Team 2, do home and away teams.
* Error handling for if/when game thread not found.
* Do multiple graphs at once for easy comparison.
* Get win probability graphs from ESPN.
